You pack your bags, take your laptop board a plane and leave. A new adventure begins.</h3><p name="0bd3" id="0bd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Since 5 months ago, I prepared for this. I found a job that won’t mind me flying around the world, I read about places I want to see and mostly prepared mentally. It took me a long time to find the courage to decide where and when and to book the flight. Probably wouldn’t happen with the encouragement of Renana, my girlfriend.</p><p name="ef0e" id="ef0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The captain just announced we’re starting our descent to Bangkok. From the airport, I’m planning to buy a plane ticket to Chiang Mai and book a hotel for the night. Tomorrow, after a good night sleep, I will go around Chiang Mai and find a better place for the next two weeks.</p><p name="abcf" id="abcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then my plan is to stay in on of Thailand’s islands, and that’s it. Back home, wherever it may be.</p><p name="59b8" id="59b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is my first digital nomad adventure and my first time in Thailand. I chose Chiang Mai from intuition and maybe because I’m looking for an easy start. Chiang Mai is a top destination for digital nomads and as such there are many places to be and many people to meet. I hope to see the community for what it really is, behind all my thoughts.</p><p name="a998" id="a998" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I chose a short stay for many reasons. Renana stayed in Israel and I’m going to miss her. I also want to see if I’m really able to work like that, and how my company will like it. They were aware that it’s going to happen soon, but until now it was only a dream. After one month here I can figure out if I can and want to do this, and continue to my next destination.</p><figure name="70ae" id="70ae" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*bPy5HX0WZ84uBNht9qLzlQ.jpeg" data-width="4032" data-height="3024" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bPy5HX0WZ84uBNht9qLzlQ.jpeg"></figure><p name="900a" id="900a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I have many fears and doubts about this trip and about this whole life style. Ideally it’s a dream come true, but what if it’s not really my dream? What if actually, I prefer having a single home somewhere without the need to move too much? What if I get lonely? or better what will happen when I get lonely? Where should I go and what should I do? I thought I’m prepared, but I’m actually doing it on a whim. I even don’t know where I will be sleeping tonight. But maybe this is the thing. To be spontaneous and travel the world to where and whenever I feel like, but also have the job that gives me the ability to be myself.</p><p name="a5aa" id="a5aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I came here to understand / achieve the following:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="cd7a" id="cd7a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Does the DN life style really suits me?</li><li name="0d78" id="0d78" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Can I really work remotely? Not from a 3 hours drive distance, but from another country?</li><li name="1a25" id="1a25" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Clean my head and focus my life and my intentions.</li><li name="20a7" id="20a7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Have lots of fun.</li></ul><p name="fbb7" id="fbb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">I’ll keep you posted, thanks for reading!</p></div></div></section>
