I arrived from my daily walk after lunch and there were a few of my group standing around a car, “helping” someone to replace a flat tire. Very silently, some pointing, some whispering, every now and then bursting with laughter about something one of them said or done.</p><p name="897b" id="897b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So this is the (first part of the) story about my first vipassana retreat. It was written in my mind during the week. In my mind, because we were instructed not to write (or read, speak, use our phone).</p><p name="f7a3" id="f7a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m starting to write it on a paper during our ride back home. Everyone around me is very cheerful, talking, laughing. But every now and then, there’s some silence, or you hear someone talks about her/his experience, and you understand we had out of the ordinary week. There’s not one of us who had an easy experience, but then, it wasn’t our intention.</p><p name="fc8c" id="fc8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The word “vipassana” is a word in Pali (the language in which the early scripture of Buddhism is written) means “insight” or “insight into the true nature of reality”. A vipassana retreat is a time interval (traditionally 10 days, but some do it for 1 week, a weekend, or even a few months — ours was a week) in which one takes a vow of silence and concentrate on mindfulness meditation practice and learning of Buddhism. Every place and school has its own tradition of how it conducts the retreat. Tovana, the organization who produced our retreat, is focusing on making mindfulness meditation approachable, and thus makes the week much less demanding in other schools. Yogis (the word for practitioners) are expected to be in silence and distract themselves in other activities (like reading, writing), but it’s not a strict law, and like in the story above, sometime you’ll see someone writing or whispering to a neighbor. I also heard that usually sports are not encouraged, but we had 1 hour each day devoted to that (running/yoga…), and a lot of walking meditations and long breaks.</p><p name="c72b" id="c72b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not to say that one approach is better, but this is definitely more easy and approachable.</p><h4 name="051c" id="051c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Schedule</h4><p name="8204" id="8204" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">We woke up every day at 6 am o’clock. We practiced a sitting meditation for 45 minutes, after which we had an hour to exercise — Whatever we chose, running, yoga, resting — and then after a short breakfast made of oatmeal and vegetables, we had our opening session — a talk by our teacher, <a href="http://www.stephenfulder.com/" data-href="http://www.stephenfulder.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stephen Fulder</a>, about the day’s subject.</p><p name="9d19" id="9d19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most of the day was made of interchanging 45 minutes sessions of walking and sitting meditations. We had a long 2 hours break for lunch and relaxing. In the evening before dinner, we had a class given by our teacher. Every day the class was about a different subject, all of them come from the Buddhist tradition. After dinner we had another cycle of sitting and walking meditation, and then the last and most favorite session, laying down meditation.</p><figure name="39c2" id="39c2" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*_rNw57K6AAlSBbWe." data-width="6000" data-height="4000" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*_rNw57K6AAlSBbWe."><figcaption class="imageCaption"><a href="https://unsplash.com/@stefnoyess?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com/@stefnoyess?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-creator noopener" target="_blank">Stef Versoza</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="photo-source noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h4 name="daf3" id="daf3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">How I started</h4><p name="f9c5" id="f9c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I’ve been meditating dayish since my birthday in July. I had an experience a few years back, which failed when I didn’t continue practicing, but it did make me understand that mindfulness has the ability to give me tools to help myself in different situations in life and I tried to return to practice since then. Going to a vipassana retreat is an idea that flowered in my mind in the last two years, and in my time in the USA I signed up for a few, but never got past the waiting list.</p><p name="d440" id="d440" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For my birthday, my mother gave me a subscription to an app called <a href="http://www.10percenthappier.com/" data-href="http://www.10percenthappier.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">10% happier</a>. The app is meant for “fidgety skeptics”, and then try to lower the volume of the “blows and whistles” of the Buddhist tradition. They don’t talk about enlightenment, after-life or anything like, they just try to teach the practice, so skeptics (as myself) can overcome their aversion of religion, and use it for their own benefit.</p><p name="7508" id="7508" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The app’s motto is “one minute counts”. They start with a series of daily classes, each is made of one video and one short meditation session. In the video Dan Harris, the app’s host, talk with Joseph Goldstein, the course teacher, and the session is led by Joseph. Each session can be between 1 minute to 10 minutes and is meant to be done once a day. After the first introduction course, there are more courses about different subjects (like how to concentrate better, how to be mindful during the day) which are led by different teachers. The common between them all is mindfulness and Dan Harris. As I got more into meditation and really started practicing every day, I began doing some unguided sessions.</p><p name="d2ca" id="d2ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the beginning, I felt very good about it. I’ve felt relaxed, I found that more of my decisions were made without regretting them, I started to think before getting angry, or better before acting angry. I was told by my girlfriend that she feels this about me. Today, I’m not sure whether I got used to the feeling or whether it just stopped. I think it’s similar to how you feel good after starting an exercise routine, and how when you get used to exercising, you also get used to that feeling or stop feeling it.</p><p name="a077" id="a077" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, like in sports, there are two options (from my viewpoint). Give up or take it to the next level. The retreat was my way of taking it to the next level.</p><h4 name="b564" id="b564" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Feelings after the retreat</h4><p name="6121" id="6121" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I started writing this right after the retreat because I wanted to have a “hot from the oven” report for myself and I had all these feelings to get out of myself. But something happened on the way back (I don’t remember what) and I stopped, and now I’m back. I feel like a few years passed already and not less than two weeks.</p><p name="13b4" id="13b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The after-feeling of the retreat was amazing. I was (again) very relaxed. I felt very clear with my thoughts and could communicate them easily. I also felt much more talkative than before, friendlier and actually happy. I started meditating 30 minutes a day first thing in the morning. I also became a bit “hippie”, not killing mosquitos and flies and feeling sad when my friends did that. One night I went out running and there was a slug on my trail, so I stopped and moved it out of the trail so it won’t get hit by runners and bikers. My talk started to be spiritual, talking about our inner happiness…</p><p name="4fe8" id="4fe8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most of that is still there, and still, my concentration in the practice is gone, I’m still doing 30 minutes a day, but I can’t concentrate as much. This is understood and I’m trying not to dwell on negative thoughts about it, just to learn from my experience and progress.</p><p name="785b" id="785b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ok, so how was the retreat? I can’t summarize in one word. It was good and hard, both physically and mentally. I didn’t enjoy the meditation for one minute after the first five minutes. My back soared, my legs started feeling weird, some muscles I didn’t know about told me stories about themselves. Don’t talk about concentration on my breath. I was totally in my suffering. And this was only the first session, I didn’t believe I’ll be able to complete this week. I’ve started counting back to the finish line, to the night, to the next meal. Counting hours, sessions, minutes, seconds.</p><p name="ab42" id="ab42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The walking sessions were better, and I actually enjoyed them. Time flew when I was walking, the concentration was much better. I enjoyed checking how slow I could walk. One session I did a circle around the retreat camp and without noticing I passed the 45 minutes limit and when I arrived at the center, they were already in the middle of a sitting session.</p><p name="3ca7" id="3ca7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Breaks weren’t better, or even worst. You couldn’t do anything, so I was bored. In the lunch break, I took a nap or a walk to pass them. Sleeping and eating became my highlights.</p><p name="67e6" id="67e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is how I passed the first three days, totally suffering and totally unaware of it. On the third day, we had a group meeting, where we could talk and share how we feel. This was the second meeting, and like in the first I didn’t have anything to share, but since this was my only time I could talk, I decided to share. I didn’t feel like it’s something to share because I felt like everyone has this feeling at the first retreat and it just passes, but when the words left my mouth I realized how much I’m suffering. I knew I suffered, but as I said I felt it was natural, and there is nothing to do about it. When I started talking I felt I’m going to cry and I’m still amazed at not doing so.</p><p name="ae4d" id="ae4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stephen, our teacher, offered a simple solution: If it’s not going well sitting on the floor, sit on a chair. If it’s still not going well on the chair, lay down. So simple, but it changed everything.</p><p name="ec2e" id="ec2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ok, so I didn’t stop hurting, or even counting back the sessions. But I started concentrating better, I stopped being afraid of the sitting sessions. I believe that if I didn’t share my experience, I would get to the end of the week, but with a feeling of failure as a yogi, and without any motivation to continue the practice.</p><p name="b61b" id="b61b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This changed my whole view of the week and the practice and today I’m still happy for going to the retreat and I’m actually looking forward to the next.</p><p name="b08e" id="b08e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not finished yet, but I am finished with this post. Hopefully, I will continue telling you about it in future posts.</p><p name="6fc4" id="6fc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Just to summarize, I think everyone should try mindfulness. It won’t change your life, but it might help you do it. You don’t have to start with a full week, even one minute counts.</p></div></div></section>
