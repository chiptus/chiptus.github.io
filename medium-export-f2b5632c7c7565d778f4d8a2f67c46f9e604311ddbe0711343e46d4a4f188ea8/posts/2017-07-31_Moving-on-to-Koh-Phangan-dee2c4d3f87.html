It wasn’t an easy decision and I thought that I can stay in Chiang Mai. But I felt that I should see some more scenery, that I should get out of the city and that I want to see the sea.</p><p name="d574" id="d574" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Chiang Mai was a wonderful experience both as a tourist and as a digital nomad. I slept in a hotel in the old city that is called CM Stay. I had a pretty big room with my own bathroom and a refrigerator.</p><p name="b767" id="b767" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Every day I was walking the streets (or taking an Uber) to find a cafe or a co-working space to work from. I checked both Punspace places (In <a href="https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Punspace+Nimman/@18.7946246,98.9702413,16.93z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x30da3a7e90bb6f5d:0x98d46270a59b4367!2sChiang+Mai,+Mueang+Chiang+Mai+District,+Chiang+Mai!3b1!8m2!3d18.7060641!4d98.9817163!3m4!1s0x0:0x958a8f7924d5a5a1!8m2!3d18.793553!4d98.9723526?hl=en" data-href="https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Punspace+Nimman/@18.7946246,98.9702413,16.93z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x30da3a7e90bb6f5d:0x98d46270a59b4367!2sChiang+Mai,+Mueang+Chiang+Mai+District,+Chiang+Mai!3b1!8m2!3d18.7060641!4d98.9817163!3m4!1s0x0:0x958a8f7924d5a5a1!8m2!3d18.793553!4d98.9723526?hl=en" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nimman</a> and in <a href="https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Punspace+Tha+Phae+Gate/@18.7858845,98.9904409,17.93z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x30da3a7e90bb6f5d:0x98d46270a59b4367!2sChiang+Mai,+Mueang+Chiang+Mai+District,+Chiang+Mai!3b1!8m2!3d18.7060641!4d98.9817163!3m4!1s0x0:0x2e49e5d62aa60eaf!8m2!3d18.7865999!4d98.9914767?hl=en" data-href="https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/Punspace+Tha+Phae+Gate/@18.7858845,98.9904409,17.93z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x30da3a7e90bb6f5d:0x98d46270a59b4367!2sChiang+Mai,+Mueang+Chiang+Mai+District,+Chiang+Mai!3b1!8m2!3d18.7060641!4d98.9817163!3m4!1s0x0:0x2e49e5d62aa60eaf!8m2!3d18.7865999!4d98.9914767?hl=en" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the old city</a>), I worked from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/eNCc7ZxgUr52" data-href="https://goo.gl/maps/eNCc7ZxgUr52" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mana</a> (My personal favorite) for a day, and also from <a href="https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/StarWork+Chiangmai/@18.796476,99.0141919,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x30da254c6ffcc5cb:0x375d86903a9983c7!8m2!3d18.796476!4d99.016386?hl=en" data-href="https://www.google.co.th/maps/place/StarWork+Chiangmai/@18.796476,99.0141919,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x30da254c6ffcc5cb:0x375d86903a9983c7!8m2!3d18.796476!4d99.016386?hl=en" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Starwork</a>, somewhere far in the north east of the city.

But I felt that I found some balance in that, and I learned some stuff about this life style which I wish to acquire to myself. Most days I finished working at around 6 pm, and after that, I went to see some site or had dinner and a beer with some friends I’ve met. I kept the weekends totally free and found the time to see some nice art (Art in paradise — amazing, go see it).</p><figure name="5e08" id="5e08" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*LQGjwTW4Wtd4yID8UGzJ9A.jpeg" data-width="2592" data-height="1944" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LQGjwTW4Wtd4yID8UGzJ9A.jpeg"></figure><p name="0972" id="0972" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I learned that as a digital nomad, I need to appreciate what I have and enjoy it. I need to enjoy the fact that if I want, at 6 pm I can climb the mountain and check the vista from there. I actually did that one day, I finished working and suddenly decided I want to do that, so I ordered an uber that took me up there. The driver came to pick me up with his friend and after Doi Suthep (The temple on the mountain) they showed me some of the city and their university — actually it was one of the nicest campuses I had ever seen (I only have a couple to compare to, but still).</p><p name="b9de" id="b9de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I learned I need to stop feeling like I’m on a vacation and to start feeling like this is my life. Everyday to wake up in a different place, work for a few hours and then walk outside and enjoy where I’m at.</p><p name="2215" id="2215" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m feeling like I really was able to work like that. I had some nice progress in my job, I found my routine and stick to it. One thing I miss (job wise) is some interaction with my boss to know how he feels about my work. This one thing that I’ll try to fix in the next two weeks.</p><p name="cd7a" id="cd7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Working in Chiang Mai is very easy. The whole city is built for it. You have good internet connection in every hotel, coffee shop, and workspace. You have many workspaces and most cafés don’t mind you sitting there for hours. I will have to see other places to know if I can really work like that. There will be places where it won’t be easy, but I guess that in these places I will need to understand that I can let go and not work for a while.</p><figure name="e025" id="e025" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ihSnh99Yrd6cfYWcSN3kxw.jpeg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ihSnh99Yrd6cfYWcSN3kxw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Overload café</figcaption></figure><p name="b267" id="b267" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I have many thoughts about the digital nomad community, workspaces, and the whole life style, but that would go on a different post. I just wanted to share that I realized that workspaces are not the thing for me, and I prefer to work out of a cafe. Workspaces felt too much like offices, which is what I wanted to avoid. Coffee shops gave me the ability to work and to see other people who are not only from my line of work.</p><p name="5e4c" id="5e4c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With that, I will end, because I want to get some sleep tonight. I’m on the night train to Surathani, from there I will take a bus and then a ferry to Koh Phangan. I hope that I will have some fun there.</p><p name="024f" id="024f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">See you in the next post, thanks for reading.</p></div></div></section>
