        "problem": "Existing chatbot platforms couldn't provide the programmatic control needed for landing page generation. We required executing custom JavaScript functions, database operations, API calls, and handling dynamic data collection (variable number of images) - capabilities locked behind rigid flow builders.",
        "solution": "Built a custom conversation framework from scratch with full programmatic control. The framework provides executable JavaScript steps, database persistence (PostgreSQL + Redis), dynamic state management, API integration, and flexible data collection. Users can navigate non-linearly while the bot executes complex business logic between interactions.",
        "impact": [
          "Full control over conversation logic and business rules",
          "Enabled complex landing page generation from natural chat",
          "Handled variable-length data collection (images, content blocks)",
          "Created reusable framework for future conversational products"
