  Tezos is a new blockchain coin written in OCaml which supports self ammendment
  and a special PoS. The creating of new blocks in Tezos is called "Baking" and
  there are various teams who bake blocks in Tezos. Each holder of tzx can
  delegate his coins for a bakery for them to be able to bake more. One of these
  teams approached me to help them with building their website.

  The website was built using Wordpress and a special theme chosen by the
  bakery. In the future we will add a small dashboard app for the bakery's
  delegators to be able to see a summary of their rewards
